# Homelab Journey

The idea behind this repo is to document my home lab journey. There are a few things I want to accomplish with this home lab. In no order:

- experiment
- self hosting
- media library, cuz everyone loves to look back at some old pics

Current topology: I expect this to change a lot in the beginning.
